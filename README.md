# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
I'd like to make a project for fantasy soccer. Users would be able to trade ERC1155 player tokens and they would also be able to play fantasy soccer with them.
1. Users will buy and sell players 
2. The marketplace will be a bidding system
3. Users can then 'slot' their players into their fantasy team and use them to play fantasy soccer (ideally there would be some reward for the best teams during any given week or season)
